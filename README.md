# skill-sample-python-petmatch
Pet Match matches the user with a pet. When launched, this Alexa Skill will prompt the user for the information it needs to determine a match. Once all of the required information is collected, it will send the data to an external web service which processes the data and returns the match. Through this workshop, you will learn how to use advanced Alexa Skills Kit features to create and configure an Alexa Skill and AWS Lambda.
